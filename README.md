## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am Akshit Garg, an enthusiast currently hacking on some of my own projects.

I love to work with cryptography, interpreters, compilers and distributed
systems. I am proficient with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org),
[ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org), [Golang](https://golang.org), JavaScript,
TypeScript and Dart amongst others. I am currently learning
[F#](https://fsharp.org), [Erlang](https://erlang.org) and
[Nix](https://nixos.org). Currently hacking with
[dos-like]https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/dos-like to make custom DOS
like controls.

As you might have guessed, I love lesser known programming languages and
systems.
